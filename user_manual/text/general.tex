\section{System Overview}
Turtlenet is a purpose-built, privacy oriented social network, which demands
zero security or technical knowledge on behalf of its users. It allows
communication between users securely, which can either be in the form of 
instant messaging, or creating posts to a series of user created 'walls.'

What makes Turtlenet significant is even the service operators are unaware of
the content of messages. It is designed from the ground up that they can never
have access, even if they wanted to. This resolves a more common security
issue that plagues modern social media networks, an issue Turtlenet has been
created to not have.
