\section{System Overview}
Turtlenet is a purpose-built, privacy oriented social network, which demands zero 
security or technical knowledge on behalf of its users. It allows communication 
between users securely, via both a form of instant messaging, and creating posts 
to a series of walls.

What makes Turtlenet significant, is even its service operators are unaware of the 
content of messages. It is designed from the ground up that they can never have 
access, even if they wanted to. This resolves the most common security issues that
plague modern social media networks, an issue Turtlenet does not have.
