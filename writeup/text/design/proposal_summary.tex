The project, a security based social media network, will have multiple components to be investigated and used in this design section. The key critical components to be looked at consist of:

database
client
client GUI
server
server GUI
mobile GUI (future work)

Of each of these components we should look at how they will impact their respective uses in order to best make use of their full functionality. We will look at multiple possible and practical solutions for the above criteria, making sure the best solution is chosen. We will also look at possible work in the future, or any areas to continue with into the coming stages.

The requirements section has helped so far through analysis of existing social media networks and how they have implemented their networks, along with how their interfaces react to the user.
