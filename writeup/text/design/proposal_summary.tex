The project, a security based social media network, will have multiple 
components to be investigated and used in this design section. The key critical 
components to be looked at consist of:

\begin{itemize}
\item Database
\item Client
\item Client GUI
\item Server
\item Server GUI
\item Mobile GUI (future work)
\end{itemize}

Of each of these components we should look at how they will impact their 
respective uses in order to best make use of their full functionality. We will 
look at multiple possible and practical solutions for the above criteria, 
making sure the best solution is chosen. We will also look at possible work in 
the future, or any areas to continue with into the coming stages.

The requirements section has helped so far through analysis of existing social 
media networks and how they have implemented their networks, along with how 
their interfaces react to the user.
