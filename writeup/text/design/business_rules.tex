In standard projects the business model can commonly outline certain validation 
practices for the program or project in the form of business rules or policies. 
Our project, and its fundamental idea, works a little different than most 
projects in terms of business, as per such we have only one business rule.

\begin{quote}

\textit{"To ensure the client never sends identifying data to the server or its 
operators."}
\end{quote}

This is to ensure that the privacy of communication is always within the hands 
of the client and user, as opposed to any who run the network. To violate this 
single rule would be going against both the company ideals, and the projects 
goals.
