I've found a website that generates QR Codes - both professionally and otherwise
for free.  We could implement it into our prgram by having the program output
the URL it gives you as because it's generated via URL, we should be able to
store it in a string and then output either that or have an image viewer in the
program to output the actual image, whichever is easiest for the user.

The website's create function: http://goqr.me/api/doc/create-qr-code/
The website's read function: http://goqr.me/api/doc/read-qr-code/
A test one I did:
