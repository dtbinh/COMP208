Another possibility of sharing our private keys with other users would be via the
form of QR codes. One of our members located a website that generates QR Codes - 
both professionally and otherwise for free. It is possible to implement it into 
our program by having the program output the URL it gives us, as because it's 
generated via URL, we should be able to store it in a string and then output 
either that or have an image viewer in the program to output the actual image, 
whichever is easiest for the user.

The website's create function: 
\url{http://goqr.me/api/doc/create-qr-code/}

The website's read function:
\url{http://goqr.me/api/doc/read-qr-code/}

Test example using the website:
\url{https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=300x300\&data=\%3Ci'mThePublicKeyVariable\%3E\&format=svg}
