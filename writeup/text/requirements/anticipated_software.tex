Description of anticipated software

\begin{itemize}
\item ensure optimal security, when passing messages, viewing profile
\item ensure server will not able to detect any activies between the users of
      the system
\item users can share posts only to specific people
\item users to keep their own data and only friends with users as well
\item users is to pass public key with any type of medium they prefer to other
      users
\end{itemize}

The purpose of this system is to emphasise on the security measures of a social
media by encrypting user details such as profile information, messages which are
used to pass to other users, and posts which are only designated for specific
users t[o read?\todo{this was missing from the original commit too}]

The system is to have strict security measures implemented. It is able to
encrypt messages with the use of RSA and AES. The only way for the other user to
decrypt the data is if it was encrypted using their public key; which is given
from the recipient to the sender via whichever medium he prefers, e.g. email.

Server capabilities are strongly limited as it only funtion is to handle the
traffic of the encrypted data between different users.
