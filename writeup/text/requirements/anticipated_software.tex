We anticipate the creation of the following software:

\begin{itemize}
\item Windows, Linux, and OSX executable: client
\item Windows, Linux, and OSX executable: server
\item Windows, Linux, and OSX executable: installer for client and server
\item Full source for server, client, and any associated works\todo{update with
names of associated works as project continues}
\end{itemize} 

The client will create and use an SQLite database, local to each client, this
database will be used to store all information that the specific client is aware
of.
