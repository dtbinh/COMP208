In facebook, 'friending' someone is symmetric; that is, if you are friends with
them, they are friends with you. The facebook severs store which user is friends
with which other users. Adding another user as a friend is simply a matter of
sending that user a friend request, and having it approved by the second user. A
user may see a list of all who are their 'friend' on FB, in the friend list.
After friending somebody that persons wall posts will appear on your news feed,
and you will be able to chat with that user.

In order to add friends, facebook allows you to see your friends friend lists,
and search by name, email, and location for other users. Facebook also suggests
other users whom you may already know IRL, based on your friends friends.
