\section{Overview of Protocol}
Tor is an imlpementation of onion routing, it routes traffic from your computer
to an entry guard. That entry guard routes it to an internal node, which in turn
routes it to an exit node. The exit node the routes the transmission to the
final destination.\todo{how are nodes found, how are nodes public keys found,
describe hidden services and directory authorities, describe hidden services
using their public key as a URL}

RSA/AES is used to ensure that only you, the exit node, and the final
destination see the plaintext traffic being routed. With the use of TLS, SSL, or
other end-to-end encryption those who see the plaintext can be reduced to you
and the final destination. However a malicous exit node can MitM SSL connections
using ssl-strip or a similar tool. There are methods of avoiding this, but it is
a serious issue because users believe that SSL is secure.

\section{Security}
Given that Tor is a low-latency network traffic can easily be correlated. This
problem is ameliorated in high-latency netowrks such as mix nets, but not
eliminated.

Tor does not seek to protect against size correlation or time correlation of
traffic. Rather the purview of tor is to conceal the IP address of a client from
the servers which it connects to.

Should a global passive adversary have perfect visibility of the internet, they
would be able to track tor traffic from source to host by correlating the size
and time of transmissions.

The Tor design doesn't try to protect against an attacker who can see or measure
both traffic going into the Tor network and also traffic coming out of the Tor
network\cite{torOneCell}. - Roger Dingledine
\end{quote}

While such an attack amy initially sound infeasable, access is only needed to
the client, the host, the entry guard, the exit node, and the internal node.
So the question becomes: how likely is it that an adversary will have access to
these five nodes?

We can safely assume that the adversary has access to the clients traffic, since
our threat model is that of a nation state seeking to spy on its citizens.
Furthermore we may assume that the adversary has access to the content host, as
our threat model assumes that service operators may be pressured legally or
otherwise into spying on their users. Therefore we must conclude, at least for
\textit{the} adversary, that Tor is unsuitable for concealing activity in
traditional social networks.

Does this then mean that Tor is insecure? No. So far as we know\cite{torStinks}
the US does not currently have the ability to reliably and consistently track
tor users; if the US is incapable of doing so, it is reasonable to assume that
no other nation state has this ability. This is however not something which
should be relied upon, therefore we shall consider Tor as unsuitable for
transmitting our data, at least if we were to do so as a traditional social
network.

users, however, no success de-anonymizing a user in response to a TOPI request/
on demand\cite{torStinks}.
