\todo{consider implementing a WOT system with levels of trust}
\todo{turn all these lists into real text}

NB: 'friend' isn't special, but merely a group of public keys the user deems
friends. They may have other groups such as 'close friend', 'family', 'coworker'
etc.\\
When I here say group, I mean it in a different sense to a facebook group, but
more like a google+ circle. Once the data dictionary is drafted, I will rewrite
with standard terminology.

\section{Profile Data}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Posted as a PDATA message to all who may view it
    \item Different versions for different people/groups
    \item New PDATA messages can update old values (change your name/email)
    \end{itemize}
    
    Fields:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Names (not unique)
        \item Username (unique, but this uniqueness is ensured by server and shouldn't
		    be trusted)
        \item Birthday
        \item Sex
        \item E-Mail
    \end{itemize}

\section{Account recovery}
Not possible without keypair, have GUI keep a backup or urge user to store a
copy on a flash drive?

\section{Posts}
    \subsection{Walls}
        Each user has their own wall.
        Posting a message on their wall
            \begin{itemize}
            \item all posts should be addressed to self so they can see their own posts
            \item to a group
            \item to a specific person or a list of people
            \item never public, this breeds bad habbits
            \item to themselves
            \end{itemize}
        
        Posting to anothers wall Is much the same as posting to your own.
        
        Sharing a link on their wall
            \begin{itemize}
            \item displayed differently in GUI, client MUST NEVER thumbnail link or
              otherwise access it without EXPLICIT user consent (see tor/js
              exploit on freedom hosting by the USA and tracking techniques
              recently thwarted by GMail caching images)
            \item can post a message along with the link
            \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Can edit old posts (though old versions still available to malicious clients)
        \item Can delete posts (though still available to malicious clients)
        \item no pictures/video/audio
        \end{itemize}
        
    \subsection{Commenting}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item All wall posts may be commented on
        \item Comments must be forwarded by original posters client to all the same
          recipients.
          (unless the original post contains a list of public keys who can see
          the message, look into this, single point of failure if implemented??)
        \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Liking}
        Any wall post may be liked. Likes are only visible to those whom you
          choose.
    
    \subsection{Events}
        Client posts a message to itself alterting it of an event, such as a
        birthday, interview, or other event.
    
\section{Interacting with other users}
    Adding someone to a group (friend/family/coworker) is asymmetric. Just
      because you add them doesn't mean they've added you. You do not require
      consent.
    
    Known people are adding by adding their public key. See CLAIM/PDATA messages
    
    Allow user to manage their list of known people into groups such as friend,
      family, and cooworker. The user defines these groups.

\section{Chat}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Real time chat between users
    \item Allow posting messages to be delivered when user logs in
    \item Save past conversations
    \item Block users from messaging you (client actually just ignores their messages)
    \end{itemize}
