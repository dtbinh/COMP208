Our goal is to produce an easy to use social network, within which nearly all
data is encrypted.

The system is to have strict security measures implemented. It is able to
encrypt messages with the use of RSA and AES. The only way for the other user to
decrypt the data is if it was encrypted using their public key; which is given
from the recipient to the sender via whichever medium he prefers, e.g. email.
We will also allow users to transmit public keys as QR codes, for ease of use.

The system will provide a platform for people to securely communicate, both
one-to-one and in groups. Users will be able to post information to all of their
friends, or a subset of them as well as sharing links and discussing matters of
interest.

The following are our main design goals, please note that the system is designed
with axiom that the server operators are evil, seeking to spy on every user, and
able to modify the source for the server.
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong cryptography protecting the content of messages
\item Make it an impossible task to derive, from the information the server has
      or is able to collect, which users send a message to which users
\item Make it an impossible task to derive, from the information the server has
      or is able to collect, which users recieve a message at all
\item Transmission of public key is easy, and doesn't require knowing what a
      public key is
\item Be intuitive and easy to use, prompting the user when required
\item Provide a rich social network experiance, so as to draw regular members
      and drive up network diversity
\end{itemize}

The server operator will have access to the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item Which IP uploaded which message (although they will be ignorant of its
content, type, recipient, and sender)
\item Which IPs are connecting to the server as clients (but not what they view,
      , whom they talk with, or whether they recieve a message at all)
\item What times a specific IP connects \footnote {While this will aid in tying
an IP address to a person, it is deemed acceptable because it is not useful
information unless the persons private key is compromised.}
\end{itemize}

A third party logging all traffic between all clients and a server will have
access to \todo{Talk about TLS, end-to-end crypto} what IPs connect to the
server, and whether they upload or downloand information \footnote{size
correlation attacks could be used here if the message content is known}

The benefits we feel this system provides over current solutions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Server operators can not know who talks with whom
\item Server operators can not know the content of messages
\item Server operators can not know which message is intended for which user
\item Server operators can not know who is friends with whom
\end{itemize}

In order to ensure nobody can tell who is talking with whom we will base our
security model on the idea of shared mailboxes, as seen in practice at
alt.anonymous.messages
\footnote{https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/alt.anonymous.messages}.
In this model one posts a message by encrypting it using the public key of the
recipient, and posting it in a public location. In this model one reads a
message by downloading all messages from that location, and attempting to
decrypt them all using ones private key. Our protocol will build atop this
simple premise, and the the server will be a mere repository of messages, the
real work occurring wholly in the client.
