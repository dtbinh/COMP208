The proposed project\todo{name project} is a simple, privacy oriented social
network, which demands zero security or technical knowledge on behalf of its
users. In order to ensure security and privacy in the face of nation state
adversaries the system must be unable spy on its users even if it wants to or
server operators are ordered to.

We feel that obscuring the content of messages isn't enough, because suspicion
may, and often does, fall upon people not for what they say, but to whom they
are speaking\todo{citation needed}. Our system will therefore not merely hide
the content of messages, but the recipient of messages too. Hiding the fact that
an IP address sent a message is out of scope, but hiding which user/keypair did
so is in scope, as is who received the message and the content of the message.
