\section{Performance Testing}
How well does the system response match the userâ€™s work
practice?

\section{Robustness Testing}
System level black box testing.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Devise a series of inputs and expected outputs.
\item Run these inputs through the system and record the actual outputs.
\item Compare the actual outputs with the expected outputs.
\end{itemize}
Inputs used should range from expected use patterns to silly as users tend to do things totally unexpected.

\section{Recoverability Testing}
How good is the system at recovering from user errors?

\section{Learnability Testing}
How long does it take a new user to become productive with
the system?

\section{Security Testing}
Are users able to view messages intended for other people?
