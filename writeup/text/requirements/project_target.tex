A project of this scope would normally have a target, outlined here in a more
formal manner. The project however, is ultimately not being done for an external
customer or supervisor, but for our own personal development. Whilst no formal
target is in mind, there are a number of possible recipients for this project.

Large multinational defence corporations such as IBM, Thales, or BAE might find
such a project useful, as it would allow for a secure communication tool between
employees in an office. It could also potentially be used outside a company
firewall to send messages securely between offices across much larger distances.
Corporations such as defence contractors often hold security in the highest
regard, and such a client would match their needs well.

A more likely recipient of this system however, is the internet itself, as we
have decided to release this project under an open source license. Should
another group decide to embark on a similar project, they will have access to
this project, to act as a baseline for their own work. More on this license
will be covered later in the document.
