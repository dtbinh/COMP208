Facebook allows a user to chat with their friends, and will inform a user of
whether their friends are online or not (though this can be faked), and whether
the user you are chatting with has read the last message that you sent them.
Facebook determines that you have read a message when... \todo{how does FB do
this?}. You are also informed whether your friend is logged in on a mobile
device or not.

Whole groups of users may chat together, in multi-user conversations. Facebook
also supports video calling and file transfer during chats. If a user does not
wish to be bothered by another using chatting with them, then they may 'mute'
that users conversion. Users spamming via chat may be reported to facebook.
Because multi-user conversations (and indeed long running one-to-one
conversations) can get rather large, facebook allows you to hide the history of
a conversation.

Facebook chat alerts the user to new messages in a conversation by playing a
sound.
