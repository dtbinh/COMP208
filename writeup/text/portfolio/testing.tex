\section{Automated Testing}
We have included a series of automated tests with Turtlenet. Each of these tests runs a different part of the system 
with predetermined data and compares the results with what we expect to receive from the part of the system currently 
being tested.

For example we can test the part of the system responsible for returning the contents of wall posts by sending it:
"11 POSTgetText". We should expect to receive "I'm posting on your wall". If we do not receive that exact message we
know that there is something wrong with the system and the developers are alerted to this.

\section{Black-box Testing}
Black-box testing comprised mainly of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Clicking on buttons even if they didn't fit into the logical work flow.
    \item Attempting to 'cheat' the system by making it it do things that aren't intended by the design.
    \item Entering silly values into various parts of the system in an attempt to see if this would break anything.
\end{itemize}

Given more time we would test more extensively and have people not familiar with the system perform Black-box testing on
our behalf.
