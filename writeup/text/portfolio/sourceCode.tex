We chose to store our source code in a Git repository hosted by Github at: 
\url{https://github.com/thomal/COMP208/}. \par

The repository records all changes to files which allows group members know 
who has modified files, what has been added and what has been deleted. \par

If more than one person edits the same file it is possible to merge together 
the work of each person, often automatically. When more than one person edits 
the same line manual intervention is required to see who's edit should be 
kept. \par

We can also look back at previous revisions of files to figure out where bugs 
were introduced or to resurrect old code that has since been removed but may 
still be useful.
