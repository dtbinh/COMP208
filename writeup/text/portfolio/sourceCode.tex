\section{Source Code}

We chose to store our source code in github.com(https://github.com/thomal/COMP208).
It record all the action did on the files, which allows all the group members know 
who modified the files, what have been added and deleted.All the recently update 
detail will shows to all the group member clearly to the group members once login 
to the system. when and what things changed, added, deleted in the file from which 
member is clearly shows up.For example, the things added to the text file will 
label as red to show all the user. Because it recorded everything we did, if 
anyone of us made a mistake, github allows us pull back the previous work from the 
server as well.It is a very useful function when we have any problem of our project.
