\chapter{Personal Statement - Michael Chadwick}
"Turtlenet allowed me to get a feel for the workings of a small group with a
 project.  As a budding software developer, this experience will prove
 invaluable as a start for greater things.
 A range of skills have been used within this project and for the tasks that
 were not allocated to me I can still get an understanding from them - 
 bolstering my own knowledge.
 As far as myself goes I have learnt more about the paperwork and planning which
 goes into an official project, as opposed to a standalone task.
 I'm glad I was able to work with members of a diverse skill set and hope that
 my future endeavours will have the same kind of diversity which bolsters the
 quality of a project."
