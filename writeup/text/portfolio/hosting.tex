We chose Amazon Web Services(AWS) to host the remote server component of Turtlenet and the project website.
The primary reason for this is that AWS offers a free package for the first 12 months of membership. The price after
this is also fairly competitive although we would probably consider other providers if the offer didn't exist.

Another advantage of AWS is due to the size of Amazon they have many servers available which lends itself to high 
performance and increased redundancy.

It is uncertain if Amazon has provided any of it's customers personal data to the NSA or another government sponsored 
spy agency. This is of little concern though as very little it stored by the Turtlenet remote server. Due to the 
distributed nature of Turtlenet all sensitive information is stored in a local database on the users device.
