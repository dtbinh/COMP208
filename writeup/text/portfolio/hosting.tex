We chose Amazon Web Services(AWS) to host the remote server component of Turtlenet and the project website.
The primary reason for this is that AWS offers a free package for the first 12 months of membership. The price after
this is also fairly competitive although we would probably consider other providers if the offer didn't exist. \par

Another advantage of AWS is, due to their size, Amazon have many servers available which lends itself to high 
performance and increased redundancy. Performance isn't a major issue as the Turtlenet remote server acts as little 
more than a middleman. Still, the lower the latency the better. \par

It is uncertain if Amazon has provided any of it's customers personal data to the NSA or any other government sponsored 
agency. This isn't of concern though as very little data is stored by the Turtlenet remote server. Due to the 
distributed nature of Turtlenet all sensitive information is stored in a local database on the users device.
