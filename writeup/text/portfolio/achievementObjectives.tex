\section{Achievement of Objectives}
We successfully produced a usable social network requiring minimal knowledge of
cryptograhpy that can be used to hide both what one says and whom one says it
to. We did not however allow users to transfer public keys as QR codes, rather
we made them copy/paste a string of text. As an extra feature we added Tor
support to hide the originting IP addresses of traffic, while this isn't as
secure as our other measures it is secure in practice, with the NSA being unable
to deanonymise Tor users\cite{torStinks}. Our pages do not autorefresh at the
moment, meaning that to see new content a user must reload the page manually.
On the other hand we added the feature of encrypting all information stored
locally, and extended the protocol so that with only a users keypair their
entire local database may be rederived on any device; this is useful for users
with multiple devices.


On the whole the missed some objectives and added a good deal more. We feel that
what we gained was far greater than what we lost, and so was worth the time we
spent on it in lieu of the unimplemented, but planned, features.
