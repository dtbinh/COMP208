Ballmer Peak (i.e.: The students which worked on Turtlenet) have waived their
rights via the CC0 licence. The university of liverpool now has sole claim
to limiting rights placed upon Turtlenet (NB: Not sole rights to it, the effect
of the CC0 waiver is to grant all the rights we had to everyone. The limitations
placed upon Turtlenet by The University Of Liverpool now apply to any user of
Turtlenet to the same extent they did to us before the waiver.).
