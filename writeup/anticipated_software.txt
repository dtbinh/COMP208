Description of anticipated software

- ensure optimal security, when passing messages, viewing profile
- ensure server will not able to detect any activies between the users of the system
- users can share posts only to specific people
- users to keep their own data and only friends with users as well
- users is to pass public key with any type of medium they prefer to other users

The purpose of this system is to emphasise on the security measures of a social media by encrypting user details such as profile information, messages which are used to pass to other users, and posts which are only designated for specific users t

The system is to have strict security measures implemented. It is able to encrypt messages with the use of RSA and AES. The only way for the other user to decrypt the data is if it was encrypted using their public key; which is given from the recipient to the sender via whichever medium he prefers, e.g. email.

Server capabilities are strongly limited as it only funtion is to handle the traffic of the encrypted data between different users.
