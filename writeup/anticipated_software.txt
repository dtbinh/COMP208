Description of anticipated software
-----------------------------------

- ensure optimal security, when passing messages, viewing profile
- ensure server will not able to detect any activies between the users of the system
- users can share posts only to specific people
- users to keep their own data and only friends with users as well
- users is to pass public key with any type of medium they prefer to other users

The system is expected to have strict security measures implemented. It will be able to encrypt messages with the use of [INSERT ENCRYPTION PROTOCOL]. The only way for the other user to decrypt the data is to obtain the public key which is given from the initial user to whichever medium he prefers, e.g. email.

Server capabilities are strongly limited as it only funtion is to handle the traffic of the encrypted data between different users.
