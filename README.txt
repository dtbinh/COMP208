Regarding Future Work
-----------------------------------------
Please update /writeup/text/ when you do work, rather than leaving it in a text
file somewhere. It is easier for everyone if they can find everyone elses work
in the contents page of project.pdf instead of digging about in the repo.
I've already created placeholder files for you to put your work into, but feel
free to create more files if you feel the need.

If anyone is unsure about how to use Git, please contact me
(luke@luke-thomas.net | 07592034395).
