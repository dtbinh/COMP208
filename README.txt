Regarding Future Work
-----------------------------------------
Please update /writeup/text/ when you do work, rather than leaving it in a text
file somewhere. It is easier for everyone if they can find everyone elses work
in the contents page of project.pdf instead of digging about in the repo.

If you're unfamiliar with LaTeX, just put your work in a text file, and insert:
    \chapter{My Section Name}
    \input{text/requirements/your_filename.tex}
in the appropriate place. The filepath is the path from the /writeup directory.
Currently it's very likely that you should add those two lines to
/writeup/text/requirements/requirements.tex as we are currently working on the
requirements.
