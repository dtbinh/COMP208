Parser should take messages like the following, and update the database:
    POST
    <authorname>
    Hello, world!
in this case the parser should call Database.addPost with appropriate arguments

NetworkConnection should send and recieve data from the server

Crypto should do crypto, and make it as simple and easy as possible

GUI should use the DB to provide a simple user interface

Database should build a database from information passed to it by the parser,
and provide easy access to that data.
